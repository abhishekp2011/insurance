Machine Learning: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction (Faculty Advisor – Dr. Sushma Jain) 			(Sep’21-Nov’21)

Project	
● Built a model to predict the insurance cost by analyzing the personal health data of individuals

Methodology	
● Visualized the data using Seaborn library and examined the distribution of response variable and predictors
● Executed data pre-processing on the dataset using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding in scikit-learn
● Implemented various ML algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest for prediction
● Implemented ANN on the dataset using Keras library and did hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Results	
● Employed Exploratory Data Analysis and recorded best R2 score of 0.87323 using Random Forest
